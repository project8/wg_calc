All of the calculations which were done supporting the waveguide design
are performed by this program and printed to screen. 

Currently, two things are calculated:
1) The guide wavelength for the TE10 mode at 26.0 GHz, and the 
   quarter guide wavelength.  This parameter is important for
   designing the overall length of the active region, as well as
   the distance from the trap region to the gas inlets.

2) A calculation which finds the minimum length of the gas inlets
   such that they act as >20dB attenuators when coupling to the gas
   tubes.
